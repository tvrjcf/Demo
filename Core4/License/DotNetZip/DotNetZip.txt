DotNetZip - Zip and Unzip in C#, VB, any .NET language



------------------------------------------------------------

DotNetZip is an easy-to-use, FAST, FREE class library and toolset for manipulating zip files or folders. Zip and Unzip is easy: with DotNetZip, .NET applications written in VB, C# - any .NET language - can easily create, read, extract, or update zip files. For Mono or MS .NET.

DotNetZip works on PCs with the full .NET Framework, and also runs on mobile devices that use the .NET Compact Framework. Create and read zip files in VB, C#, or any .NET language, or any scripting environment. DotNetZip supports these scenarios:
- an ASP.NET app that dynamically creates ZIP files and allows a browser to download them
- a Windows Service that periodically zips up a directory for backup and archival purposes
- a WPF program that modifies existing archives - renaming entries, removing entries from an archive, or adding new entries to an archive
- a Windows Forms app that creates AES-encrypted zip archives for privacy of archived content.
- An administrative script in PowerShell or VBScript that performs backup and archival.
- a WCF service that receives a zip file as an attachment, and dynamically unpacks the zip to a stream for analysis
- an old-school ASP (VBScript) application that produces a ZIP file via the COM interface for DotNetZIp
- a Windows Forms app that reads or updates ODS files
- creating zip files from stream content, saving to a stream, extracting to a stream, reading from a stream
- creation of self-extracting archives.

If all you want is a better DeflateStream or GZipStream class to replace the one that is built-into the .NET BCL, DotNetZip has that, too. DotNetZip's DeflateStream and GZipStream are available in a standalone assembly, based on a .NET port of Zlib. These streams support compression levels and deliver much better performance that the built-in classes. There is also a ZlibStream to complete the set (RFC 1950, 1951, 1952).
